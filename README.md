1st testbench implement addition of three numbers 10, 20 and 30 stored in processor registers.

2nd testbench implement loading of a word stored in memory loca>on 120, add 45 to it, and store the result
in memory location 121.

3rd testbench implement computation of factorial of a number N stored in memory loca>on 200. The
result will be stored in memory loca>on 198.
